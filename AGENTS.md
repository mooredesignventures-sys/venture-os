# AGENTS.md

- PR mode only (never commit to `main`).
- No new dependencies unless you ask first.
- No unrelated refactors and no formatting sweeps.
- Always run build/test/lint if available and paste outputs in PR description.
- If blocked or unclear, ask ONE question only.
- Keep changes minimal and reviewable.
